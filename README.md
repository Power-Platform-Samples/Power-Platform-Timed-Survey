# Overview
At Microsoft, we cherish and care about our employees. They are an integral part of Microsoft. They are Microsoft's greatest asset. At all times, we ensure that their voices are heard. To understand what needs to change within the organization, Microsoft surveys and speaks with its employees about the current state of work. They listen to the inputs, reviews, and suggestions of employees. This culture is one of the most surprising reasons why Microsoft's stock will keep rising. Would you love to embed this culture in your organization and get reviews from your employees at frequent intervals?

Microsoft's Power Platform can help make this happen. This sample showcases how you can integrate an automated employee review system in your organization using either Power Apps or Power Virtual Agents. Your automated system would share the survey with employees in your organization at the scheduled time and date, collect all responses, and upload them in real-time on SharePoint. From SharePoint, you can visualize the results to gain confirmed insights for growing your organization using Power BI.

In SharePoint, we would need to create a List. A SharePoint List is a collection of data that you can share with your team members and people who you've provided access to. Our database 

I would show you how to integrate this into your organization's Teams tenant using 2 different Power Platform technologies. First with Power Apps and next with Power Virtual Agents.
