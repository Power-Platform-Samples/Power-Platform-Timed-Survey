# Overview
At Microsoft, we cherish our customers and want to offer the best value to them. Most importantly, we care about our employees even more. They are an integral part of Microsoft. They are Microsoft's greatest asset. Microsoft surveyed and spoke to employees about what the culture currently looked like to understand what needs to change. Then they listened to the inputs, reviews, and suggestions of their employees. This culture is one of the most surprising reasons why Microsoft's stock will keep rising.  Would you love to embed this culture in your organization and get reviews from your employees at frequent intervals?

Microsoft's Power Platform can help make this happen. This sample showcases how to automate this process in your organization, collect all responses, and visualize the results to get confirmed insights for growing your organization.
