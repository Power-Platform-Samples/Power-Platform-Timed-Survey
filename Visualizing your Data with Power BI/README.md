# Overview
CONGRATULATIONS ON GETTING THIS FAR! By now you must have successfully built and connected your Power Apps application or Power Virtual Agent bot to SharePoint. All data collected from the responses of our employees is stored on SharePoint. Data is knowledge. Good data  allows organizations to more effectively determine the cause of problems. To be able to communicate business insights in a constructive manner, we need to make use of visualizations.

Power BI is a Data Visualization and Business Intelligence tool that converts data from different data sources including SharePoint to interactive dashboards and BI reports. It is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights. Power BI let's you easily connect to your data sources, visualize and discover what's important, and share that with anyone or everyone you want.
