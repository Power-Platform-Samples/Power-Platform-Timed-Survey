# Overview
CONGRATULATIONS ON GETTING THIS FAR! By now you must have successfully built and connected your Power Apps application or Power Virtual Agent bot to SharePoint. All data collected from the responses of our employees is stored on SharePoint. Data is knowledge. Good data  allows organizations to more effectively determine the cause of problems. To be able to communicate business insights in a constructive manner, we need to make use of visualizations.

Power BI is a Data Visualization and Business Intelligence tool that converts data from different data sources including SharePoint to interactive dashboards and BI reports. It is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights. Power BI let's you easily connect to your data sources, visualize and discover what's important, and share that with anyone or everyone you want.

Power BI consists of several elements that all work together. In this sample, we would be focusing on 2 of them:
* Power BI service: Power BI service or Power BI online is a cloud-based service, or software as a service (SaaS) online. You can build dashboards that help you keep a finger on the pulse of your business. Itâ€™s designed for light report editing and collaboration.
* Power BI Desktop: Power BI Desktop is a desktop application that allows you connect, transform, and visualize data. You can conect to more than one different data source and combine them into a data model. You can build visuals, and collections of visuals which can be shared as reports with other people inside your organization.

In this section, I would show you how to visualize your data stored on SharePoint using Power BI Online or Power BI Desktop.

# Visualizing data with Power BI Online
Did you know that you can easily visualize your SharePoint data with Power BI in seconds? Yes I meant that. Let's learn how to do that. We start off by going back to our SharePoint List. By now, our list should have some more data in it after testing our Power Apps application and Power Virtual Agent bot.

Click on 'Integrate' in the top navbar of the screen, then 'Power BI' and 'Visualize the list' as shown in the image below.

Immediately you do, Power BI Online opens up in a new window. If you haven't already, you would be prompetd to sign in. If you have signed in, your screen should be similar to the one in the image below.

Data visualizations like the ones in the image above should give us clear idea of what the information we are trying to pass across to our audience is and what it means. This makes the data more natural for the human mind to comprehend and therefore makes it easier to identify trends and patterns which would improve your organization. The visualization above though doesn't totally meet this criteria.

In this documentation, I would not show you how to work with Power BI. ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢ But I've got something for you. I would be sharing 3 links that would help you. Check out
