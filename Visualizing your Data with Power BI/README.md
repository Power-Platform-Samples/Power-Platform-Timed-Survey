# Overview
CONGRATULATIONS ON GETTING THIS FAR! By now you must have successfully built and connected your Power Apps application or Power Virtual Agent bot to SharePoint. All data collected from the responses of our employees is stored on SharePoint. Data is knowledge. Good data  allows organizations to more effectively determine the cause of problems. To be able to communicate business insights in a constructive manner, we need to make use of visualizations.

Power BI is a Data Visualization and Business Intelligence tool that converts data from different data sources including SharePoint to interactive dashboards and BI reports. It is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights. Power BI let's you easily connect to your data sources, visualize and discover what's important, and share that with anyone or everyone you want.

Power BI consists of several elements that all work together. In this sample, we would be focusing on 2 of them:
* Power BI service: Power BI service or Power BI online is a cloud-based service, or software as a service (SaaS) online. You can build dashboards that help you keep a finger on the pulse of your business. Itâ€™s designed for light report editing and collaboration.
* Power BI Desktop: Power BI Desktop is a desktop application that allows you connect, transform, and visualize data. You can conect to more than one different data source and combine them into a data model. You can build visuals, and collections of visuals which can be shared as reports with other people inside your organization.

In this section, I would show you how to visualize your data stored on SharePoint using Power BI Online or Power BI Desktop.
