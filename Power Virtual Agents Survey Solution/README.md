# Overview
Microsoft's Power Virtual Agent allows you create powerful bots that can answer questions in seconds without the help of data scientists or developers. You can decide to create your bot and integrate as a standalone web application, share on Microsoft Teams, on your website, on cortana, telegram, slack or kik.

Using a Power Automate flow connected to your bot, you can collect responses from your users, collate and upload those responses on SharePoint. Love to see how to make this happen? Let's begin!

# Building our bot with Power Virtual Agents

- First give your bot a name. I would name mine **SurveySolution**. 
- Then select a language you would like to create your bot in. 
- You are also expected to select an environment. I would use my default environment since that was where my Power Apps application was created in. An environment is a space where your organization can store, manage, and share business data, apps, and flows. Pick the environment you would like to use. 
- Once I have filled in all details correctly, click 'Create'.
