# Overview
Microsoft's Power Apps is a low-code development platform that enables you build enterprise applications (applications created for use within your organization not for consumer consumption) within minutes. But wait! Asides allowing you build applications for your business, Power Apps has other MAD skills.

With Power Apps, you can build applications that run on web, Android, and iOS devices. Power Apps provides an easy to use drag-and-drop interface that allows you add different controls (checkbox, choice field, buttons, drop-down, or text field), forms, and media (video, image, or audio files) into whatever application you are building. It also allows you store and connect to external data sources inside your app.

# Building our App from SharePoint
We would be connecting Power Apps to our SharePoint List which we created earlier. Here's how you can do that.
- On your SharePoint List, click on 'Integrate', then 'Power Apps', then 'Create an app'.

- Give your app a name and click on 'Create'. I would name it "SurveySolution".

- You would be redirected to Power Apps Studio where you can redesign your application to suite your needs. The next screen would be like the image below.

Employees at Microsoft have a busy time at work, so it is important we keep this application as simple and easy to navigate as possible. We would be editing our design so employees can submit their responses in less than 20 seconds and while navigating through just 3 screens.
* A welcome and get started screen,
* A screen where they fill in their response to the survey questions, and
* A success screen informing them that their response has been submitted.

Let's starting redesigning!
